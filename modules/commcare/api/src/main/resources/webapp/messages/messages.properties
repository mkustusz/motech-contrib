settings.tooltip.eventStrategy=There are three different strategies for case event forwarding: minimal (default), partial and full. The minimal event includes only the case ID. The partial event passes in all of the basic case data that are not case specific. The full implementation will also include field values, which for some implementations could bloat the event.
